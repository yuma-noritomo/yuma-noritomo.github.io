          <p> We study the long-run effects of catastrophic drought insurance on pastoralist households in Kenya and Ethiopia. Instrumenting with randomized premium discounts, we estimate the impacts of insurance coverage a decade later. Insurance coverage induced households to herd fewer small livestock like goats, typically used as precautionary savings in the short run, an effect which persisted in the long-run. Insurance also generated a significant long-run increase in children’s education. These effects are driven by households with small baseline herds, reflecting reduced child labor demand. We provide suggestive evidence that these impacts stem from reduced \textit{ex ante} risk exposure and the behavioral change it induces, rather than from \textit{ex post} indemnity payments.  </p>

      <p>
        Poor households in developing countries often face trade-offs between children’s schooling and labor.
        Using data on pastoralist households in rural Kenya and Ethiopia–where livestock require care and generate
        within-household demand for child labor–I exploit quasi-random variation in rangeland grazing conditions
        that affects both household income and labor demand to estimate the impact of productivity shocks during
        childhood on educational attainment. Positive productivity shocks during preschool ages increase completed
        schooling, primarily by raising the probability of primary school entry, consistent with the relaxation of
        short-term liquidity constraints. In contrast, negative productivity shocks during primary school ages–
        when children are most likely to exit school and child labor productivity increases–are associated with
        higher educational attainment. This effect appears to operate through significant reductions in livestock
        holdings that lower subsequent demand for boys’ labor in animal husbandry and probably reinforce the
        effect by inducing sedentarization. These results highlight the importance of non-separable household
        production and human capital decisions in shaping educational outcomes during critical stages of childhood
        in low-income settings.

          <!-- <p>How do imports from China affect local labour markets in Japan? We examine this question using commuting zones as regional units and analysing shock propagation through supply chains and co-location patterns. Applying the method proposed by Autor et al. (American Economic Review, 103, 2121, 2013) and Acemoglu, Autor et al. (Journal of Labor Economics, 34, S141, 2016), we examine the impact of import shocks on regional manufacturing employment using input–output tables which allows us to investigate the propagation of shocks to both upstream and downstream industries and to relate the regional impact to industry co-location patterns. We find that the negative direct effect on local employment is underestimated in previous studies that do not consider the regional propagation of the shock through supply chains, especially the positive shock to downstream industries. Downstream industries in Japan, for example, significantly benefit from imports from China as they lower input prices and increase employment. In contrast to downstream industries, we find no significant impact on upstream industries. Our results imply that the direct negative effect on local labour markets is somewhat mitigated by effects on downstream industries within the same region.</p> -->
